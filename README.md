#Purpose
The initial goal of this project is to create an application which will
analyze data on the results of Hearthstone games. At this phase of the
project the data will be mocked.

#Long term goals
The ideal long term outcome of the project is to incorperate a
deterministic method for picking the best card to play in a given
circumstance and using this algorithm generate large sets of results to
test the effectiviness of decklists and thier perfromance after slight
variation.

#Install
This project is going to be built with Ruby. Step by step instructions
will be added as they are needed.
